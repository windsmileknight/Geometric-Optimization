# GI-Optimization (Geometry intuitive - optimization)
This program is created to build undertanding of various gradient-descent based optimization algorithms in a geometric way.

# What GI-Optimization can do?
1. Using bulitin optimization target function to generate thier 3D plot. Or, you can define your own function under opt/function.py with sympy.
2. Play with optimization algorithm already implemented in ./opt (classical optimizer including vanilla gradient descent, momentum, NAG, AdaGrad, RMSprop, AdaDelta). Also, you can complement other optimizer under ./opt, using main.py to execute.
3. Generate gradient descent process gif. Note that the generating process might be long, it's depend on the optimizing step (each step is a frame).
4. If you want to go deeper, ./reference provides several papers about those optimization algorithms.

# Still need to improve
It's just a demo right now. I will reconstruct the whole program once all functions are settled down.
**Note that I complement the 3D plot of optimization target function, which means that there are only two parameter need to be updated.**

# Comments and suggestions are welcome! Have fun!
